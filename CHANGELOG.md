## 0.1.0

First release. Dart surface only — no native implementation yet.

* `ArMeasure.isAvailable()` — runtime check, never inferred from the device
  model. A missing plugin, a simulator, or a bundle without the native side
  all surface as `arSupported == false`.
* `ArMeasure.parseSample()` — builds an `ArMeasureSample` from raw channel
  data. Never throws: an unknown `status` returns `null`, and a status with no
  accompanying numbers still parses with `measurement == null`.
* `ArMeasureStatus` — eight values covering the full lifecycle of a measuring
  session, including the interruptions that are not the app's fault
  (`interrupted`, `cameraUnauthorized`).
* `ArMeasureView` — a thin `UiKitView` wrapper. Draws nothing itself; every
  number and every label is the caller's job.
* iOS only. No network calls, no permissions requested by this package.
